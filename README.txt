The objective of this project is to develop a health management system/platform 
that would not only help patients manage their health care better, but also make 
the doctorâ€™s job easier. One of the main objectives is to make communication
between the doctor and patients more convenient as well as more efficient. With a 
platform that is easy to navigate and use, patients and doctors would be able to
communicate with ease. Many people still contact their doctors through phone calls,
which we know, always have a long queue to wait for the next person available to 
take the call. We want to make it easy to contact your doctor, schedule or 
reschedule appointments, and as well as allowing patients to get access to their 
medical history, lab results, prescriptions, etc. With a system like this, 
many people can manage their health care on the website instead of making dozens of
calls back and forth.
